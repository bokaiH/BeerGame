# BeerGame

The Beer Game is a simulation game commonly used for supply chain management education, aiming to demonstrate the dynamics and complexities within a supply chain. This
project has implemented a Beer Game based on a gym environment, utilizing two reinforcement learning algorithms: Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
to train intelligent agents. This report will introduce the main classes and functions in the project, including the BeerGame class, Agent class, the implementation of the DQN algorithm,
the implementation of the PPO algorithm, and the overall workflow of the project.
